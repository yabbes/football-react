## Football React

Web app built with ReactJS accessing the [Football-Data API](www.football-data.org) **not** via XMLHttpRequest, **not** with JQuery, but using an ES6 *.fetch()* :)

This is also probably my cleanest ReactJS app so far, I tried to built it modular so that it is scalable. This is also a work in progress, but I deployed the status quo at [etbim.de/foot](http://www.etbim.de/foot)
